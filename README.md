# Nikita’s dotfiles

This is a collection of my configuration files.

## Installation

**Warning:** If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork this repository, review the code, and remove things you don’t want or need (especially `.bash/env.sh`).

You can clone the repository wherever you want. (I like to keep it in `~/Projects/dotfiles`, see `.bash/env.sh`).

## Feedback

Suggestions/improvements are [welcome](https://github.com/NKBelousov/dotfiles/issues)!
